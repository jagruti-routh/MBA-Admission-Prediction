# 🎓 MBA Admission Prediction using Machine Learning  

This project builds a predictive model to determine the likelihood of admission for MBA aspirants based on academic and profile factors.  

## 🚀 Objective  
To help universities and admission committees evaluate applications efficiently and provide insights into important factors influencing admission decisions.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (EDA & Visualization)  
- Scikit-learn (Model Building & Evaluation)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📊 Key Steps  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – handled missing values, normalized scores  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – trends, correlations, feature importance  
3. **Model Training** – Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest  
4. **Evaluation** – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC  

## 🏆 Results  
- Achieved **~85% accuracy** in predicting admissions  
- Identified key factors like GMAT scores, GPA, and work experience
